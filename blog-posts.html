                        <p class="card-text">Well this concludes the first week on campus at Awesome Inc! This week was
                            mainly focused on one project, creating a campaign site for a candidate running for
                            Constable. I really enjoyed working on this project, it was a lot of fun. This was probably
                            the first design-heavy project we've worked on, aside from the blog of course. Now I do have
                            a small background in design, nothing extravagant really, I just have an eye for making
                            things look decent. It was nice however to get a touch up on design <abbr
                                title="Contrast, Repitition, Alignment, Proximity">CRAP</abbr> as there is always room
                            for improvement. One thing I felt was especially important was focusing on usablity, making
                            sure that a site was workable and readable over looking nice. I know I've been guilty of
                            that in the past and it is a mistake I won't be repeating any time soon. I'm looking forward
                            to talking about fonts. I have very strong opinions about fonts and the weight they have in
                            design. All in all this was a great week and I'm really excited to see where the rest of the
                            bootcamp takes me!</p>

                        <p class="card-text">This is the last week of the pre-work, hard to believe it's already here.
                            This past week involved four seperate Javascript projects: a image gallery, a countdown
                            timer,
                            a digital clock, and a mind reader. You can see all of these projects <a class="text-muted"
                                href="projects.html">here.</a> My biggest gripe with these projects was with the image
                            gallery, namely
                            that the guidelines were rather poorly written. I would have preferred if we were asked to
                            start from scratch rather than use pre-existing code. Other than that things were pretty
                            smooth.
                            Knowing how to use breakpoints was very helpful with figuring out what was going wrong, as
                            well as using console.log() to show my results and fix any problems I was having.
                            All in all I'm really excited to be starting on Monday. </p>

                        <p class="card-text">This has been quite the week. We started on Javascript and created our
                            first project, a silly story generator (linked under projects). This one turned out
                            to be a lot more difficult than I thought, but for entirely the wrong reason. I had my code
                            written out and it was all functioning perfectly except for the
                            very end of the function, which was supposed to turn the text visible, but wasn't. I spent
                            hours racking my brain against this only to discover after taking it
                            to the bootcamp, it was just a miss-spelling of the word 'visiblity'. Needless to say I was
                            relieved to finally get it fixed. After playing with Javascript for a
                            little, I can say it has what feels like it offers an endless ammount of customizations to
                            websites, and I look forward to trying it out and seeing what I can do with it!</p>

                        <p class="card-text">This week will be focused on the discussion of Psuedo code. To be honest,
                            I'm not a big fan of this format. I see the reasoning behind it
                            as well as its uses, but it feels somewhat redundant to me. I feel if that we're going to
                            write out code in a readable format, it shoulod be more
                            shorthand rather than detailing the step-by-step methods of writing it. I suppose the most
                            difficult part for me with the whole thing is the fact
                            that I can't test out whether or not it even works, which means any mistake I made while
                            writing will stay there with me unable to know until much further down the line.
                            I know that flowcharts are an alternative to this that while more resource intensive are
                            more interesting to me. I'm really excited to move onto Javascript, simply
                            so I can fiddle around with it on my blog. I have a few ideas that I think Javascript can
                            help me implmement. Not too much else to report for this week, as technically this week
                            and last week are the same week, since we only created the blog into week 2. More to follow
                            soon!</p>

                        <p class="card-text"> Well that's one week down! With that first week behind me
                            for assignments I can safely say I'm excited to see where
                            this program is going to lead me. The pre-work is a lot more
                            interactive than what I was expecting, which is good. I really enjoy the
                            stand-up sessions we have, simply because it helps me pace out where I should be
                            and get any help I need with the assignments. I'm still struggling with CSS at the
                            moment, mainly with just the cascading element to it. With time -and practice- I'm sure
                            I can get it down. This blog is going to be great help with that. I'm really excited to
                            dive into javascript. I've never done too much with it, and even then that was quite a
                            while ago, and I know it has so much potential to change how sites function. All in all I'm
                            really excited to see where the bootcamp goes and what it leads to in the future!</p>
