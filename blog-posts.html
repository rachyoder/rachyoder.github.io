                            With the conclusion of Week Four (Week Eight if you count the pre work) we are now
                            officially done with vanilla JS. Next up is React and NPM, and I must say I'm pretty
                            excited. From what I've heard it will be challenging but it saves so much time on things
                            we've already done in vanilla. It will be nice to try something new, although I'm not sure I
                            fully understand how it works yet, so that's probably a good place to start. Also in other
                            news, I got my machine learning project into a working state! (<a
                                href="https://rachyoder.github.io/tic-tac-toe-app/">See Here.</a>) This was such a fun
                            project to work on, and I'm glad I decided to do it. I learned a lot about working with
                            objects and creating large numbers of states with little differences between them. There are
                            still a few bugs to work out, but I'll patch those out soon enough. It was just a relief to
                            get it working in time for demo day. Going forward I'm definitely making it a priority to hit those strech goals.

                            Week Three has come and gone and boy was it stressful. We were finishing the fourth of the
                            JavaScript projects we have been working on and it ended in a bit of a time crunch. I didn't
                            quite get done in time, but I do intend to finish it Monday. I feel I've learned so much in
                            such a short time. JavaScript is an extremely useful language, but it certainly has it's
                            quirks. Object-oriented programming is very confusing and I still struggle to wrap my head
                            around it. I think it will just take some practice to learn it, but it can still be
                            frustrating. That is definitely something I want to focus on in the coming week for sure.
                            One unfortunate downside is my lack of time to work on my stretch goal project. I'm trying
                            to build a learning AI for tic-tac-toe, but haven't had much time to work on it because of
                            the other projects currently going on. I need to make a bigger push on that, as I want it
                            done by the end of next week. Otherwise, things are looking good so far. I'm excited to
                            start with React soon, and see how that works.

                            Well that's week two out of the way. (Week six if you count the pre-work.) This week was all
                            about Javascript, and I gotta say, I feel like I've made a huge jump in terms of what I knew
                            at the start of the week compared to what I know now at the end. We had four projects to
                            complete over the course of this week and next week, all involving vanilla JavaScript. As of
                            writing this I've completed two of them and submitted the third for review, so I feel like
                            I'm making good progress. One of the biggest learning experiences for me was how I paced
                            myself. The third project, the calculator, is a great example for this. I had been dreading
                            this one since the start of the week, but when the time came to complete it things went
                            rather smooth. By this point I had learned to take it in chunks. I started by setting up the
                            UI, and when I had finished that I moved onto responsive inputs, then the logic, etc. This
                            way I wasn't jumping around feeling unfocused and trying to get everything done at the same
                            time, and made it a lot easier to finish. I also made a bigger push to write <abbr
                                title="Don't Repeat Yourself">DRY</abbr>> code. It pushed me to think outside the box,
                            and made what I wrote easier to understand. I feel this is a hugely important aspect to keep
                            in mind, espcially moving forward, as it is benefical for anyone involved, including myself.
                            As long as I get into the habit of these good coding practices, all should be well.

                        <p class="card-text">Well this concludes the first week on campus at Awesome Inc! This week was
                            mainly focused on one project, creating a campaign site for a candidate running for
                            Constable. I really enjoyed working on this project, it was a lot of fun. This was probably
                            the first design-heavy project we've worked on, aside from the blog of course. Now I do have
                            a small background in design, nothing extravagant really, I just have an eye for making
                            things look decent. It was nice however to get a touch up on design <abbr
                                title="Contrast, Repitition, Alignment, Proximity">CRAP</abbr> as there is always room
                            for improvement. One thing I felt was especially important was focusing on usablity, making
                            sure that a site was workable and readable over looking nice. I know I've been guilty of
                            that in the past and it is a mistake I won't be repeating any time soon. I'm looking forward
                            to talking about fonts. I have very strong opinions about fonts and the weight they have in
                            design. All in all this was a great week and I'm really excited to see where the rest of the
                            bootcamp takes me!</p>

                            This past week involved four seperate Javascript projects: a image gallery, a countdown
                            timer,
                            a digital clock, and a mind reader. You can see all of these projects <a class="text-muted"
                                href="projects.html">here.</a> My biggest gripe with these projects was with the image
                            gallery, namely
                            that the guidelines were rather poorly written. I would have preferred if we were asked to
                            start from scratch rather than use pre-existing code. Other than that things were pretty
                            smooth.
                            Knowing how to use breakpoints was very helpful with figuring out what was going wrong, as
                            well as using console.log() to show my results and fix any problems I was having.
                            All in all I'm really excited to be starting on Monday. </p>

                            first project, a silly story generator (linked under projects). This one turned out
                            to be a lot more difficult than I thought, but for entirely the wrong reason. I had my code
                            written out and it was all functioning perfectly except for the
                            very end of the function, which was supposed to turn the text visible, but wasn't. I spent
                            hours racking my brain against this only to discover after taking it
                            to the bootcamp, it was just a miss-spelling of the word 'visiblity'. Needless to say I was
                            relieved to finally get it fixed. After playing with Javascript for a
                            little, I can say it has what feels like it offers an endless ammount of customizations to
                            websites, and I look forward to trying it out and seeing what I can do with it!</p>

                        <p class="card-text">This week will be focused on the discussion of Psuedo code. To be honest,
                            I'm not a big fan of this format. I see the reasoning behind it
                            as well as its uses, but it feels somewhat redundant to me. I feel if that we're going to
                            write out code in a readable format, it shoulod be more
                            shorthand rather than detailing the step-by-step methods of writing it. I suppose the most
                            difficult part for me with the whole thing is the fact
                            that I can't test out whether or not it even works, which means any mistake I made while
                            writing will stay there with me unable to know until much further down the line.
                            I know that flowcharts are an alternative to this that while more resource intensive are
                            more interesting to me. I'm really excited to move onto Javascript, simply
                            so I can fiddle around with it on my blog. I have a few ideas that I think Javascript can
                            help me implmement. Not too much else to report for this week, as technically this week
                            and last week are the same week, since we only created the blog into week 2. More to follow

                            this program is going to lead me. The pre-work is a lot more
                            interactive than what I was expecting, which is good. I really enjoy the
                            stand-up sessions we have, simply because it helps me pace out where I should be
                            and get any help I need with the assignments. I'm still struggling with CSS at the
                            moment, mainly with just the cascading element to it. With time -and practice- I'm sure
                            I can get it down. This blog is going to be great help with that. I'm really excited to
                            dive into javascript. I've never done too much with it, and even then that was quite a
                            while ago, and I know it has so much potential to change how sites function. All in all I'm
                            really excited to see where the bootcamp goes and what it leads to in the future!</p>
