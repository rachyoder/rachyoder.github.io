                            I was intimidated by this project before I even started it. You think of a calculator and
                            imagine a lot of math going into it to function. However, this project went pretty smooth
                            for me. I think by the time I arrived at it something had clicked inside my brain and I
                            finally "got it" in a sense. I was able to get the basics up and running fairly smoothly and
                            the rest of my time was spent adding quality of life features and ironing out edge cases and
                            the occasional bug. I will say that it would be nice to automate the bug testing in some
                            way, because it is a rather time consuming and repetitive process. This project really did
                            help me gain some confidence in my ability to write Javascript, and understand what I'm
                            writing as well. All that's left is to see if I still feel this way after the next
                            project...

                            The tic-tac-toe game turned out to be a bit more puzzling than I thought it would be. In
                            retrospect it wasn't a hard project, but it was right at the point where the difficulty was
                            ramping up and I still wasn't quite comfortable with JavaScript. By the end of it however, I
                            felt I was a lot stronger with it than when I started. The main challenge I had trouble with
                            was dynamically rendering hy html through Javascript, as this was something I had never done
                            before. By the end I felt I had a good grasp on the concept, but it made styling my page a
                            much bigger challenge than I had originally anticipated. Going forward I'm looking to expand
                            on this project by experimenting with machine learning, similary to <a

                            This was the first of four projects we did on our more advanced look at vanilla JavaScript.
                            We were tasked with building a weather app that would pull local weather based on a zip code
                            input by the user. The big focus with this project was the use of an API as well as
                            importing a JSON file for the data. All in all this was probably the simplest of the four
                            projects, and I definitely learned some useful skills moving forward, especially with API
                            keys, which is something I will definitely be using with my final project.

                            We
                            made a
                            simple
                            game involving a number of balls bouncing on screen and a player controlled circle tried
                            to
                            capture them all. Objects and prototypes seem like a rather difficult concept to wrap my
                            head around, but they seem to have a lot of applications, so I'm interested to see what
                            we
                            do with them going forward.</p>

                            candidate running for Constable. The main goal of this project was to familiarize
                            ourselves
                            with bootstrap. This mainly involved using as little css as possible and mixing and
                            matching
                            various bootstrap components. This project also had us create personas and stories for
                            helping with the layout of our website, explaining how someone would use our site if
                            they
                            were to open up to it.</p>

                        <p id="scroll" class="card-text">The Mind Reader project was mainly a demonstration of single
                            page
                            applications and working with states. It runs through a game
                            where the user is asked to pick a number from a range of 01 - 99, and follow the prompts
                            on
                            the screen. At the end the program returns
                            a symbol to correspond with whatever symbol the user picked. This was the final project
                            we
                            did before the pre-work ended and the classes
                            officially started, and it was probably my favorite project of the pre-work itself.
                            There
                            was much less hand holding than most of the previous
                            projects so far and it really showed me how useful things like pusedocode are to helping

                            so similar
                            to each other. The digital clock is -you guessed it- a clock that displays the
                            time for you! This project was rather simple, especially following the previous project of
                            the countdown timer, as both of these were focused on learning
                            about increments and the Date object.</p>

                            clock in quite
                            a few ways. They both were very informing about the Date object as well as intervals
                            and other timing methods. As you can probably figure from the title of this project the
                            purpose is to count down to a specific time and alert the user when that happens. <br>

                            select an image and blow it
                            up into the viewer. This is definitely something I can see myself using in the future as I
                            do my own
                            photography from time to time, and being able to display photos in an interesting way is
                            always a good thing.
                            My one issue with this project is that you are provided with a lot of code to start with,
                            which does take away
                            from the challenge that I feel is important to a new developer. </p>

                            Javascript. Nothing too high concept here, it was just an
                            exercise in functions and if statements, as well as declaring variables. It did help me
                            learn the importance of proper
                            syntax with Javascript though. </p>

                        <p id="scroll" class="card-text pb-5">This project was all about page layouts and relative
                            sizing
                            for
                            images, a very useful skill to have when dealing with
                            varying screen sizes. Formatting for mobile is a very big priority. All in all, this project
                            was rather simple, as most elements
                            were provided from the start.</p>
