                        The Mind Reader project was mainly a demonstration of single page applications and working with states. It runs through a game 
                        where the user is asked to pick a number from a range of 01 - 99, and follow the prompts on the screen. At the end the program returns 
                        a symbol to correspond with whatever symbol the user picked. This was the final project we did before the pre-work ended and the classes 
                        officially started, and it was probably my favorite project of the pre-work itself. There was much less hand holding than most of the previous 
                        projects so far and it really showed me how useful things like pusedocode are to helping initialize projects. <br>

                    <dd>
                        The next two projects can be grouped together as the tasks were so similar to each other. The digital clock is -you guessed it- a clock that displays the 
                        time for you! This project was rather simple, especially following the previous project of the countdown timer, as both of these were focused on learning 
                        about increments and the Date object. <br>

                    <dd>
                        As mentioned above the countdown timer ties into the digital clock in quite a few ways. They both were very informing about the Date object as well as intervals 
                        and other timing methods. As you can probably figure from the title of this project the purpose is to count down to a specific time and alert the user when that happens. <br>

                        This project was an interesting one for sure. The goal was to be able to select an image and blow it 
                        up into the viewer. This is definitely something I can see myself using in the future as I do my own 
                        photography from time to time, and being able to display photos in an interesting way is always a good thing.
                        My one issue with this project is that you are provided with a lot of code to start with, which does take away 
                        from the challenge that I feel is important to a new developer. <br>

                    <dd>
                        The silly story generator was our first project with Javascript. Nothing too high concept here, it was just an 
                        exercise in functions and if statements, as well as declaring variables. It did help me learn the importance of proper 
                        syntax with Javascript though. <br>

                        This project was all about page layouts and relative sizing for images, a very useful skill to have when dealing with 
                        varying screen sizes. Formatting for mobile is a very big priority. All in all, this project was rather simple, as most elements 
                        were provided from the start. <br>
