            <h3><strong>Week Four</strong></h3>
            <p>
              This is the last week of the pre-work, hard to believe it's already here. This past week involved four seperate Javascript projects: a image gallery, a countdown timer, 
              a digital clock, and a mind reader. You can see all of these projects <a href="projects.html">here.</a> My biggest gripe with these projects was with the image gallery, namely
              that the guidelines were rather poorly written. I would have preferred if we were asked to start from scratch rather than use pre-existing code. Other than that things were pretty smooth.
              Knowing how to use breakpoints was very helpful with figuring out what was going wrong, as well as using console.log() to show my results and fix any problems I was having. 
              All in all I'm really excited to be starting on Monday. 
            </p>
            <h3><strong>Week Three</strong></h3>
            <p>
              This has been quite the week. We started on Javascript and created our first project, a silly story generator (linked under projects). This one turned out 
              to be a lot more difficult than I thought, but for entirely the wrong reason. I had my code written out and it was all functioning perfectly except for the 
              very end of the function, which was supposed to turn the text visible, but wasn't. I spent hours racking my brain against this only to discover after taking it 
              to the bootcamp, it was just a miss-spelling of the word 'visiblity'. Needless to say I was relieved to finally get it fixed. After playing with Javascript for a 
              little, I can say it has what feels like it offers an endless ammount of customizations to websites, and I look forward to trying it out and seeing what I can do with it!
            </p>
            <br>
            <h3><strong>Week Two</strong></h3>
            <p>This week will be focused on the discussion of Psuedo code. To be honest, I'm not a big fan of this format. I see the reasoning behind it 
               as well as its uses, but it feels somewhat redundant to me. I feel if that we're going to write out code in a readable format, it shoulod be more 
               shorthand rather than detailing the step-by-step methods of writing it. I suppose the most difficult part for me with the whole thing is the fact 
               that I can't test out whether or not it even works, which means any mistake I made while writing will stay there with me unable to know until much further down the line.
               I know that flowcharts are an alternative to this that while more resource intensive are more interesting to me.  I'm really excited to move onto Javascript, simply 
               so I can fiddle around with it on my blog. I have a few ideas that I think Javascript can help me implmement. Not too much else to report for this week, as technically this week
               and last week are the same week, since we only created the blog into week 2. More to follow soon!
            </p>
            <br/>
            <h3><strong>Week One</strong></h3>
            <p>
              Well that's one week down! With that first week behind me 
              for assignments I can safely say I'm excited to see where 
                this program is going to lead me. The pre-work is a lot more 
                interactive than what I was expecting, which is good. I really enjoy the
                stand-up sessions we have, simply because it helps me pace out where I should be
                and get any help I need with the assignments. I'm still struggling with CSS at the 
                moment, mainly with just the cascading element to it. With time -and practice- I'm sure
                I can get it down. This blog is going to be great help with that. I'm really excited to 
                dive into javascript. I've never done too much with it, and even then that was quite a 
                while ago, and I know it has so much potential to change how sites function. All in all I'm 
                really excited to see where the bootcamp goes and what it leads to in the future!
