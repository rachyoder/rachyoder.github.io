                <h3><strong>Week One</strong></h3>
                <p>Well that's one week down! With that first week behind me 
                  for assignments I can safely say I'm excited to see where 
                  this program is going to lead me. The pre-work is a lot more 
                  interactive than what I was expecting, which is good. I really enjoy the
                  stand-up sessions we have, simply because it helps me pace out where I should be
                  and get any help I need with the assignments. I'm still struggling with CSS at the 
                  moment, mainly with just the cascading element to it. With time -and practice- I'm sure
                  I can get it down. This blog is going to be great help with that. I'm really excited to 
                  dive into javascript. I've never done too much with it, and even then that was quite a 
                  while ago, and I know it has so much potential to change how sites function. All in all I'm 
                  really excited to see where the bootcamp goes and what it leads to in the future!</p>
