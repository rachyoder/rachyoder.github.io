              <h3><strong>Week Two</strong></h3>
              <p>This week will be focused on the discussion of Psuedo code. To be honest, I'm not a big fan of this format. I see the reasoning behind it 
                as well as its uses, but it feels somewhat redundant to me. I feel if that we're going to write out code in a readable format, it shoulod be more 
                shorthand rather than detailing the step-by-step methods of writing it. I suppose the most difficult part for me with the whole thing is the fact 
                that I can't test out whether or not it even works, which means any mistake I made while writing will stay there with me unable to know until much further down the line.
                I know that flowcharts are an alternative to this that while more resource intensive are more interesting to me.  I'm really excited to move onto Javascript, simply 
                so I can fiddle around with it on my blog. I have a few ideas that I think Javascript can help me implmement. Not too much else to report for this week, as technically this week
                and last week are the same week, since we only created the blog into week 2. More to follow soon!

                <h3><strong>Week One</strong></h3>
                <p>Well that's one week down! With that first week behind me 
                  for assignments I can safely say I'm excited to see where 
                  this program is going to lead me. The pre-work is a lot more 
                  interactive than what I was expecting, which is good. I really enjoy the
                  stand-up sessions we have, simply because it helps me pace out where I should be
                  and get any help I need with the assignments. I'm still struggling with CSS at the 
                  moment, mainly with just the cascading element to it. With time -and practice- I'm sure
                  I can get it down. This blog is going to be great help with that. I'm really excited to 
                  dive into javascript. I've never done too much with it, and even then that was quite a 
                  while ago, and I know it has so much potential to change how sites function. All in all I'm 
                  really excited to see where the bootcamp goes and what it leads to in the future!</p>
